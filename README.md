# book_shelves
this repo is designed to allow books the user wants to read to be tracked by 'to read', 'in progress', or 'read'

## A user will be able to add, delete, and move around books to different shelves(lists) based on how they want books to be categorized. 
- More likely, no delete: all is 'to read' or 'read'...or reading
- may be able to drop book if the reader really doesn't want it in there collection
